# Corrected Nginx config for conf.d/default.conf: Only upstream and server blocks (fit inside global http).
# Why fixed? Removed top-level 'events {}' and 'http {}'—these are already in main nginx.conf.
# Placement: This file is included INSIDE http {}, so directives like upstream/server are allowed here.
# Deep logic: Nginx merges configs hierarchically. Global: events (connections) + http (web). Site-specific (conf.d):
#   - upstream: Backend pools (your apps).
#   - server: Virtual hosts (routes by domain/port).
# For multi-apps: Add more upstream/server or location blocks—no rewrap needed.

# Upstream for Auto-SQL app (Streamlit backend)
upstream auto-sql {
    server auto-sql:8501;  # Internal pointer to your Streamlit container (same host).
                           # Why upstream? Groups backends (add more servers for load balancing later).
}

# Upstream for Blockchain Context app (add your actual service name and port)
# Uncomment and configure when you add the second app to docker-compose
# upstream blockchain-context {
#     server blockchain-context:8502;  # Adjust port based on your app
# }

server {
    listen 80;             # Public HTTP door (browser/EC2 IP:80).
    server_name _;         # Wildcard: Matches any domain (use EC2 IP for now; change to yourdomain.com later).

    # Default route: Landing page showing available apps

        index index.html;                     # Default file to serve
